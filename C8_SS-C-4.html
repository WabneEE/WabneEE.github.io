    <a href="C8_SS-C-4.pdf" class="book animated-link"
      ><h2>See The Chapter PDF</h2></a
    >
    <h2>Topics in the Chapter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>What is the Role of the Judiciary?</span></li>
      <li><span>What is an Independent Judiciary?</span></li>
      <li><span>What is the Structure of Courts in India?</span></li>
      <li><span>What are the Different Branches of the Legal System?</span></li>
      <p>→ PIL</p>
      <p>→ Importance of Judiciary</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is the Role of the Judiciary?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Judiciary work is divided into the following types:</span></li>
      <p>
        → <span>Dispute Resolution</span>: The judicial system resolves
        <span
          >disputes between citizens, between citizens and the government</span
        >, between two state governments and between the centre and state
        governments.
      </p>
      <p>
        → <span>Judicial Review</span>: The judiciary is the final
        <span>interpreter</span>
        of the Constitution therefore, it has the power to strike down
        particular laws passed by the Parliament if it believes that these are a
        violation of the basic structure of the Constitution. This is called
        judicial review.
      </p>
      <p>
        → <span>Upholding the Law and Enforcing Fundamental Rights</span>: Every
        citizen of India can approach the
        <span>Supreme Court or the High Court</span> if they believe that their
        Fundamental Rights have been violated.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is an Independent Judiciary?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The other branches of the State-like the
        <span>legislature and the executive</span> - cannot interfere in the
        work of the judiciary.
      </li>
      <li>
        The courts are not under the government and do not act on their behalf.
      </li>
      <li>
        All judges in the High Court as well as the Supreme Court are appointed
        with very little interference from other branches of government.
      </li>
      <p>→ After appointment, it is very difficult to remove a judge.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is the Structure of Courts in India?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>There are three different levels of courts in our country:</span>
      </li>
      <p>
        <span>1<sup>st</sup></span
        >Supreme Court of India
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>2<sup>nd</sup>High Courts of States </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>3 <sup>rd</sup>District Courts</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        → <span>Supreme Court of India</span>: Located in New Delhi and is
        presided over by the Chief Justice of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        → <span>High Courts of States</span>: Each state has a High Court which
        is the highest court of that state.
      </p>
      <p>
        → <span>Subordinate or district courts</span>: These courts at the
        district or Tehsil level or in towns and presided over by a District
        Judge.
      </p>
      <li>
        The decisions made by <span>higher courts</span> are binding on the
        <span>lower courts</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A person can appeal to a higher court if they believe that the judgment
        passed by the lower court is not just through the appellate system.
      </li>
      <li>The Indian legal system deals with civil and criminal cases:</li>
    </ul>
    <table class="table3">
      <tr>
        <th>Criminal Law</th>
        <th>Civil Law</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          It deals with conduct or acts that the law defines as offences. For
          example, theft or murder.
        </td>
        <td>
          It deals with any harm or injury to rights of individuals. For
          example, disputes relating to sale of land.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          It usually begins with the lodging of FIR with the police who
          investigate the crime after which a case is filed in the court.
        </td>
        <td>
          A petition has to be filed before the relevant court by the affected
          party only.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          If found guilty, the accused can be sent to jail and also fined.
        </td>
        <td>The court gives the specific relief asked for.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Does Everyone Have Access to the Courts?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Theoretically, all citizens of India can access the courts in this
        country.
      </li>
      <li>
        In reality access to courts has always been difficult for a vast
        majority of the poor in India.
      </li>
      <p>
        → Legal procedures involve a lot of money and paperwork as well as take
        up a lot of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        → For a poor person who cannot read and whose family depends on a daily
        wage, the idea of going to court to get justice often so remote.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>PIL</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</span> is introduced by Supreme
        Court in the early <span>1980s</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It allowed any individual or organisation to
        <span>file a PIL in the High Court or the Supreme Court</span> on behalf
        of those whose rights were being violated.
      </li>
      <li>
        A letter or telegram addressed to the Supreme Court or the High Court
        could be treated as a PIL.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Importance of Judiciary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The judiciary has played a crucial role in democratic India.</li>
      <li>
        It also keep a check on the powers of the
        <span>executive and the legislature</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, it helps in protecting the <span>Fundamental Rights</span> of
        citizens.
      </li>
