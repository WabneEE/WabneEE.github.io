    <h2>Introduction To Rational Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      In the chapter Rational Numbers for Class 8, we will learn about rational
      numbers, their properties, how to represent rational numbers on a number
      line, and also to find rational numbers between any two rational numbers
      with the help of examples.
    </p>
    <h2>Whole Numbers and Natural Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="math-span">Natural Numbers</span>
      are set of numbers starting from 1 counting up to infinity. The set of
      natural numbers is denoted as 'N'. Set of Natural Numbers (N) =
      {1,2,3,...}
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="math-span">Whole Numbers</span>
      are set of numbers starting from 0 and going up to infinity. So basically
      they are natural numbers with the zero added to the set. The set of whole
      numbers is denoted as 'W'. Whole Numbers (W) = {0,1,2,3,...}
    </p>
    <h2>Properties of Natural Numbers and Whole Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="math-span">Closure Property</span>
      Closure property is applicable for whole numbers in the case of
      <span class="math-span">addition</span>
      and
      <span class="math-span">multiplication</span>
      while it isn't in the case of subtraction and division. This applies to
      natural numbers as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Commutative Property</span>
      Commutative property applies for whole numbers and natural numbers in the
      case of addition and multiplication but not in the case of subtraction and
      division.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Associative Property</span>
      Associative property applies to whole numbers and natural numbers in the
      case of addition and multiplication but not in the case of subtraction and
      division.
    </p>
    <h2>Integers</h2>
    <p>
      In simple terms
      <span>Integers</span>
      are
      <span>natural</span>
      numbers and their
      <span>negatives</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of Integers is denoted as 'Z' or 'I'. Set of Integer Numbers (Z) =
      {...,-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...}
    </p>
    <h2>Properties of Integers</h2>
    <p>
      <span>Closure Property:</span>
      Closure Property applies to integers in the case of addition, subtraction
      and multiplication but not division.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Commutative Property:</span>
      Commutative property applies to integers in the case of addition and

    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Associative Property:</span>
      Associative property applies to integers in the case of addition and
      multiplication but not subtraction and division.
    </p>
    <h2>Rational Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      A
      <span>rational number</span>
      is a number that can be represented as a fraction of two integers in the
      form of
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">p</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">q</span>
      </span>
      , where q must be non-zero. The set of rational numbers is denoted as Q.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, -
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">5</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">7</span>
      </span>
      is a rational number where -5 and 7 are integers. Even 2 is a rational
      number since it can be written as
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">1</span>
      </span>
      where 2 and 1 are integers.
    </p>
    <h2>Properties of Rational Numbers</h2>
    <h3>Closure Property of Rational Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      For any two rational numbers a and b, a∗b=c∈Q i.e. For two rational
      numbers say a and b the results of addition, subtraction and
      multiplication operations give a rational number. Since the sum of two
      numbers ends up being a rational number, we can say that the
      <span>closure property applies</span>
      to rational numbers in the case of
      <span>addition</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: The sum of
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      +
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">3</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">4</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">(8+9)</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">12</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">17</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">12</span>
      </span>
      is also a rational number where 17 and 12 are integers. The difference
      between two rational numbers results in a rational number. Therefore, the
      <span>closure property applies</span>
      for rational numbers in the case of
      <span>subtraction</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: The difference between
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">5</span>
      </span>
      -
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">3</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">4</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">(16-15)</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">20</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">1</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">20</span>
      </span>
      is also a rational number where 1 and 20 are integers. The multiplication
      of two rational numbers results in a rational number. Therefore we can say
      that the
      <span>closure property applies</span>
      to rational numbers in the case of
      <span>multiplication</span>
      as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: The product of
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">1</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">2</span>
      </span>
      × (-
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">5</span>
      </span>
      ) = (-
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">10</span>
      </span>
      ) = (-
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">5</span>
      </span>
      ) which is also a rational number where -2 and 5 are integers. In the case
      with the division of two rational numbers, we see that for a rational
      number a, a÷0 is not defined. Hence we can say that the
      <span>closure property does not apply</span>
      for rational numbers in the case of
      <span>division</span>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>Commutative Property of Rational Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      For any two rational numbers a and b, a∗b = b∗a. i.e.,
      <span>Commutative property</span>
      is one where in the
      <span>result</span>
      of an equation must
      <span>remain the same</span>
      despite the
      <span>change in the order of operands</span>
      . Given two rational numbers a and b, (a+b) is always going to be equal to
      (b+a). Therefore
      <span>addition</span>
      is
      <span>commutative</span>
      for rational numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      +
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      +
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      <br />
      ⇒
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">6</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">6</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      <br />
      ⇒ 2 = 2
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the difference between two rational numbers a and b, (a−b) is
      never the same as (b−a). Therefore,
      <span>subtraction</span>
      is not commutative for rational numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      -
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      = -
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      but
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      -
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we consider the product of two rational numbers a and b, (a×b) is the
      same as (b×a). Therefore,
      <span>multiplication</span>
      is
      <span>commutative</span>
      for rational numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      ×
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">8</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">9</span>
      </span>
      and
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">4</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      ×
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      =
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">8</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">9</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the division of two numbers a and b, (a÷b) is different from
      (b÷a). Therefore
      <span>division</span>
      is
      <span>not commutative</span>
      for rational numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">2</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">3</span>
      </span>
      is definitely different from
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">3</span>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        <span class="den">2</span>
      </span>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>Associative Property of Rational Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      For any three rational numbers a,b and c, (a∗b)∗c=a∗(b∗c). i.e.,
      Associative property is one where the result of an equation must remain
      the same despite a change in the order of operators.
    </p>
    <p>Given three rational numbers a,b and c, it can be said that:</p>
    <p>
      (a+b)+c = a+(b+c).
      <br />
      Therefore
      <span>addition</span>
      is
      <span>associative</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      (a−b)−c≠a−(b−c).
      <br />
      Because (a-b)-c = a-b-c whereas a-(b-c) = a-b+c. Therefore we can say that
      <span>subtraction</span>
      is not
      <span>associative</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      (a×b)×c=a×(b×c).
      <br />
      Therefore
      <span>multiplication</span>
      is
      <span>associative</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      (a÷b)÷c≠(a÷b)÷c.
      <br />
      Therefore division is not associative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
      <br />
      <span class="frac">
        <span class="num">1</span>

      The number of rational numbers between any two given rational numbers

      , unlike that of whole numbers and natural numbers.

      Given two rational numbers, ensure both of them have the
