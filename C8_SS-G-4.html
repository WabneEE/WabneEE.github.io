      </li>
      <li>

    <h3>Timeline of Iron and Steel industry's location</h3>
    <p>→ Before 1800: near raw materials, power and water.</p>
    <p>→ 1850–1900: near coalfields, canals, railways.</p>
    <p>→ After 1950: on large flat land near seaports to import ores.</p>

    <h3>Jamshedpur</h3>
    <p>
      TISCO started in 1907 at Sakchi (now Jamshedpur), near Subarnarekha &
      Kharkai rivers.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Sakchi was chosen to set up the steel plant</h3>
    <p>→ 32 km from Kalimati station on Bengal‑Nagpur railway.</p>
    <p>→ Close to iron ore, coal, manganese, and Kolkata market.</p>
    <p>→ Water supply via Kharkai & Subarnarekha rivers.</p>
    <p>→ Coal from Jharia, ore and minerals from Odisha & Chhattisgarh.</p>
    <p>→ Government support provided capital.</p>

    <h3>Pittsburgh</h3>
    <p>→ A major steel city in the USA.</p>

    <h3>Why iron and steel industry developed in Pittsburgh</h3>
    <p>
      → Local coal; iron ore from Minnesota (~1,500 km away) via Great Lakes and
      rail.
    </p>
    <p>→ Rivers (Ohio, Monongahela, Allegheny) supply water.</p>
    <p>
      → Steel mills located along river valleys; finished steel sent via land &
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      → Support industries making railroad equipment, heavy machinery, rails.
    </p>
    <h2>Cotton Textile Industry</h2>
    <p><span>Based on fibre type:</span></p>
    <p>→ Natural: wool, silk, cotton, linen, jute.</p>
    <p>→ Man‑made: nylon, polyester, acrylic, rayon.</p>
    <p>Before Industrial Revolution: hand spinning/weaving.</p>
    <p>18th cen: power looms in Britain → global mechanized textile mills.</p>
    <p>Major producers: India, China, Japan, USA.</p>

    <h3>Ahmedabad</h3>
    <p>→ Located on Sabarmati river in Gujarat; first mill in 1859.</p>
    <p>→ Called “Manchester of India”.</p>

    <h3>Why textile industry developed in Ahmedabad</h3>
    <p>→ Close to cotton-growing areas → raw material.</p>
    <p>→ Ideal climate for spinning/weaving.</p>
    <p>→ Flat land for mills.</p>
    <p>→ Skilled & semi-skilled labour from Gujarat & Maharashtra.</p>
    <p>→ Good road/rail network for transporting textiles.</p>
    <p>→ Nearby Mumbai port for importing machinery and exporting goods.</p>
    <p>
      → Recent challenges: mill closures due to newer centres and lack of
      modernization.
    </p>

    <h3>Osaka</h3>
    <p>→ A major textile centre in Japan — “Manchester of Japan”.</p>

    <h3>Why textile industry developed in Osaka</h3>
    <p>→ Flat plains → land for mills.</p>
    <p>→ Warm humid climate suitable for spinning/weaving.</p>
    <p>→ Yodo river provides water.</p>
    <p>→ Skilled labour available.</p>
    <p>→ Port for importing cotton and exporting fabrics.</p>
    <p>→ Industry relies on imported cotton (Egypt, India, China, USA).</p>
    <p>
      → Textile industry later replaced by iron & steel, machinery,
      shipbuilding, autos, electrical, cement.
    </p>

    <h3>Locational advantages Silicon plateau - Bangalore</h3>
    <p>→ Most educational institutions & IT colleges in India.</p>
    <p>→ Dust-free environment, low rents & cost of living.</p>
    <p>→ First state IT policy introduced in 1992.</p>
    <p>→ Wide availability of skilled managers/workforce.</p>

    <h3>Locational advantages of Silicon valley - California</h3>
    <p>→ Close to advanced scientific & tech centres.</p>
    <p>→ Pleasant climate and clean environment.</p>
    <p>→ Ample space for growth.</p>
    <p>→ Near major roads and airports.</p>
    <p>→ Good market access and skilled workforce.</p>
