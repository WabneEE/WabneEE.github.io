    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        People with their demands and abilities are considered as
        <span>Human Resources</span>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Human resources</span>
        like other resources are not equally distributed over the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        They differ in their
        <span>educational levels</span>
        ,
        <span>age</span>
        and
        <span>sex</span>
        . Their numbers and characteristics also keep changing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Distribution of Population</h2>
    <p>
      The way in which people are spread across the earth surface is known as
      the pattern of
      <span>population distribution</span>
      .
    </p>
    <p>The distribution of population in the world is extremely uneven.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        More than 90 per cent of the world’s population lives in about 30
        percent of the land surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Crowded areas</span>
        : South and south east Asia, Europe and north eastern North America.
      </li>
      <li>
        Almost three-quarters of the world’s people live in two continents:
        <span>Asia</span>
        and
        <span>Africa</span>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        Sixty percent of the world’s people live in just 10 countries:
        <span>China</span>
        ,
        <span>India</span>
        ,
        <span>USA</span>
        ,
        <span>Indonesia</span>
        ,
        <span>Brazil</span>
        ,
        <span>Pakistan</span>
        ,
        <span>Bangladesh</span>
        ,
        <span>Nigeria</span>
        ,
        <span>Russian Fed.</span>
        and
        <span>Japan</span>
        .
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Density of Population</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Population density</span>
        is the number of people living in a unit area of the earth’s surface.
      </li>
      <li>It is normally expressed as per square km.</li>
      <li>
        The average density of population in the whole world is 51 persons per
        square km.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>South Central Asia</span>
        has the highest density of population.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors affecting distribution of Population</h2>

    <h3>Geographical Factors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Topography</span>
        : People always prefer to live on plains rather than mountains and
        plateaus because these areas are suitable for farming, manufacturing and
        service activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: The
        <span>Ganga plains</span>
        are the most densely populated areas of the world while mountains like
        <span>Andes</span>
        ,
        <span>Alps</span>
        and
        <span>Himalayas</span>
        are sparsely populated.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Climate</span>
        : People usually avoid extreme climates that are very hot or very cold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example:
        <span>Sahara desert</span>
        is very hot and polar regions of
        <span>Russia</span>
        ,
        <span>Canada</span>
        and
        <span>Antarctica</span>
        are cold and sparsely populated.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Soil</span>
        : Fertile soils provide suitable land for agriculture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: Fertile plains such as
        <span>Ganga</span>
        and
        <span>Brahmaputra</span>
        in
        <span>India</span>
        ,
        <span>Hwang-He</span>
        ,
        <span>Chang Jiang</span>
        in
        <span>China</span>
        and the
        <span>Nile</span>
        in
        <span>Egypt</span>
        are densely populated.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Water</span>
        : People prefer to live in the areas where fresh water is easily
        available.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: The river valleys of the world are densely populated while
        deserts have sparse population.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Minerals</span>
        : Areas with mineral deposits are more populated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: Diamond mines of
        <span>South Africa</span>
        and discovery of oil in the
        <span>Middle east</span>
        lead to settling of people in these areas.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Social, Cultural and Economic Factors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Social</span>
        : Areas of better housing, education and health facilities are more
        densely populated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example:
        <span>Pune</span>
        .
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Cultural</span>
        : Places with religion or cultural significance attract people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example:
        <span>Varanasi</span>
        ,
        <span>Jerusalem</span>
        and
        <span>Vatican city</span>
        .
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Economic</span>
        : Industrial areas attract large number of people as it provide
        employment opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example:
        <span>Osaka</span>
        in
        <span>Japan</span>
        and
        <span>Mumbai</span>
        in
        <span>India</span>
        .
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Population Change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Population change refers to change in the number of people during a
        specific time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The change happens due to changes in the number of births and deaths.
      </li>
      <li>Until the 1800s, the world’s population grew steadily but slowly.</li>
      <li>
        Large numbers of babies were born, but they died early too as there were
        no proper health facilities.
      </li>
      <li>Also, sufficient food was not available for all the people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In 1804, the world’s population reached one billion.</p>
    <p>
      In 1959, the world’s population reached 3 billion which is often called
      population explosion.
    </p>
    <p>In 1999, 40 years later, the population doubled to 6 billion.</p>
    <p>
      The main reason for this growth was that with better food supplies and
      medicine, deaths were reducing, while the number of births still remained
      fairly high.
    </p>

    <h3>Natural Growth Rate</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Birth rate</span>
        : The number of live births per 1,000 people.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Death rate</span>
        : The number of deaths per 1,000 people.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Migrations</span>
        is the movement of people in and out of an area.
      </li>
      <li>
        The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country is
        called the
        <span>natural growth rate</span>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        The population increase in the world is mainly due to rapid increase in
        natural growth rate.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Migration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Migration</span>
        is another way by which population size changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Emigrants</span>
        are people who leave a country.
      </li>
      <li>
        Countries like the
        <span>United States of America</span>
        and
        <span>Australia</span>
        have gained in-numbers by in-migration or immigration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Immigrants</span>
        are those who arrive in a country.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Sudan</span>
        is an example of a country that has experienced a loss in population
        numbers due to out-migration or emigration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Patterns of Population Change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rates of population growth vary across the world.</li>
      <li>
        Countries like
        <span>Kenya</span>
        have high population growth rates as they had both high birth rates and
        death rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Countries like
        <span>United Kingdom</span>
        , population growth is slowing because of both low death and low birth
        rates.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Population Composition</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Population composition</span>
        refers to the structure of the population.
      </li>
      <li>
        It tells about
        <span>age</span>
        ,
        <span>sex</span>
        ,
        <span>literacy level</span>
        ,
        <span>health condition</span>
        ,
        <span>occupation</span>
        and
        <span>income level</span>
        of population.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Population pyramid</span>
        , also called an age-sex pyramid is a way to study the population
        composition of a country.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Population pyramid</h3>
    <p>A population pyramid shows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The total population divided into various age groups, example: 5 to 9
        years, 10 to 14 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        The percentage of the total population, subdivided into males and
        females, in each of those groups.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are two groups of dependents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Young dependents</span>
        (aged below 15 years)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Elderly dependents</span>
        (aged over 65 years)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Those between the age of 15 years and 65 years are working age and are the
      economically active.
    </p>

    <p>
      The population pyramid tells us how many dependents there are in a
      country.
    </p>

    <p>
      The population pyramid of a country in which birth and death rates both
      are high is broad at the base and rapidly narrows towards the top because
      although many children are born, a large percentage of them die in their
      infancy, relatively few become adults and there are very few old people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
      <span>Kenya</span>
      .
    </p>

    <h3>Population pyramid of Kenya</h3>
    <p>
      The countries where death rates (especially amongst the very young) are
      decreasing, the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups, because more
      infants survive to adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      These countries contain a relatively large number of young people and
      which means a strong and expanding labour force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
      <span>India</span>
      .
    </p>

    <h3>Population pyramid of India</h3>
    <p>
      The countries where death rates are decreasing allow numbers of people to
      reach old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
      <span>Japan</span>
      .
