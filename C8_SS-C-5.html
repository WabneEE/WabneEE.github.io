    <h2>Who Are Adivasis?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tribals are also referred to as Adivasis.</li>
      <li>
        Adivasi means "original inhabitants" – communities who have
        traditionally lived in close association with forests.
      </li>
      <li>They make up about 8% of India’s population.</li>
      <li>
        Most of India's mining and industrial centres are located in Adivasi
        areas such as:
        <p>→ Jamshedpur</p>
        <p>→ Rourkela</p>
        <p>→ Bokaro</p>
        <p>→ Bhilai</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Adivasis are not a homogeneous population – there are over 500 different
        Adivasi groups in India.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are particularly numerous in states such as:

        <p>→ Chhattisgarh</p>
        <p>→ Jharkhand</p>
        <p>→ Madhya Pradesh</p>
        <p>→ Odisha</p>
        <p>→ Gujarat</p>
        <p>→ Maharashtra</p>
        <p>→ Rajasthan</p>
        <p>→ Andhra Pradesh</p>
        <p>→ West Bengal</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            North-eastern states like Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur,
            Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Odisha alone has around 60 different tribal groups.</li>
      <li>
        Adivasi communities are distinctive because:
        <p>→ There is often very little internal hierarchy among them.</p>
        <p>
          → This makes them different from caste-based or monarchy-based
          societies.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Adivasis practise a variety of tribal religions, distinct from Islam,
        Hinduism, and Christianity.
      </li>
      <li>
        They worship:
        <ul>
          <p>→ Ancestors – worshipped at home.</p>
          <p>
            → Village spirits – worshipped at sacred groves within the village
            boundary.
          </p>
          <p>
            → Nature spirits – associated with landscape features like
            mountains, rivers, and animals.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Adivasi religions have been influenced by surrounding religions such as:
        <p>→ Shakta</p>
        <p>→ Buddhism</p>
        <p>→ Vaishnavism</p>
        <p>→ Bhakti movement</p>
        <p>→ Christianity</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Adivasi religious traditions also influenced dominant regional
        religions:
        <ul>
          <p>→ Jagannath cult of Odisha</p>
          <p>→ Shakti and Tantric traditions in Bengal and Assam</p>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the 19th century, many Adivasis converted to Christianity, making it
        significant in modern Adivasi history.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adivasis have their own languages, many of which:
        <ul>
          <p>→ Are radically different from and possibly as old as Sanskrit</p>
          <p>→ Have influenced mainstream Indian languages like Bengali</p>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Santhali has:
        <ul>
          <p>→ The largest number of speakers among Adivasi languages</p>
          <p>
            → A significant body of publications, including online magazines and
            e-zines
          </p>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Adivasis and Stereotyping</h2>
    <p>
      Adivasis are portrayed in very stereotypical ways – in colourful costumes,
      headgear and through their dancing. Besides this, we seem to know very
      little about the realities of their lives. This wrongly leads to people
      believing they are exotic, primitive and backward.
    </p>
    <h3>Adivasis and Development</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Forests covered a major part of our country until the 19th century
      </li>
      <li>
        Adivasis had a deep knowledge of, access to, as well as control over
        most of these vast tracts at least till the middle of the nineteenth
        century. They were not ruled by large states and empires. Instead, often
        empires heavily depended on Adivasis for the crucial access to forest
        resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the pre-colonial world, they were traditionally ranged
        hunter-gatherers and nomads and lived by shifting agriculture and also
        cultivating in one place. For the past 200 years, Adivasis have been
        increasingly forced – through economic changes, forest policies and
        political force applied by the State and private industry – to migrate
        to lives as workers in plantations, at construction sites, in industries
        and as domestic workers. For the first time in history, they do not
        control or have much direct access to the forest territories.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the 1830s onwards, Adivasis from Jharkhand and adjoining areas
        moved in very large numbers to various plantations in India and the
        world – Mauritius, the Caribbean and even Australia. India’s tea
        industry became possible with their labour in Assam. Today, there are 70
        lahks Adivasis in Assam alone. For example, in the 19th century alone, 5
        lahks Adivasis had perished in these migrations.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <span>Forestlands</span> - cleared for timber and to get land for
      agriculture and industry. Adivasis lived in areas that were rich in
      minerals and other natural resources, which were taken over for mining and
      other large industrial projects. Powerful forces collude to take over
      tribal land forcefully, and procedures are not followed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        According to official figures, over 50% of persons displaced due to
        mines and mining projects are tribals. Another recent survey report by
        organisations working among Adivasis shows that 79% of the persons
        displaced from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and
        Jharkhand are tribals. Huge tracts of their lands have also gone under
        the waters of hundreds of dams that have been built in independent
        India.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Northeast, their lands remain highly militarised. India has 104
        national parks covering 40,501 sq km and 543 wildlife sanctuaries
        covering 1,18,918 sq km. These are areas where tribals originally lived
        but were evicted from. When they continue to stay in these forests, they
        are termed encroachers. Losing their lands and access to the forest
        means that tribals lose their main sources of livelihood and food.
        Having gradually lost access to their traditional homelands, many
        Adivasis have migrated to cities in search of work where they are
        employed for very low wages in local industries or at building or
        construction sites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Poverty and deprivation situations Adivasis are caught in. 45% of tribal
        groups in rural areas and 35% in urban areas live below the poverty line
        leading to deprivation in other areas- malnourished tribal children- low
        Literacy rates-When Adivasis are displaced from their lands, they lose
        much more than a source of income-lose their traditions and customs – a
        way of living and being. As you have read, there exists an
        interconnectedness between the economic and social dimensions of tribal
        life. Destruction in one sphere naturally impacts the other. Often this
        process of dispossession and displacement can be painful and violent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Minorities and Marginalisation</h2>
    <p>
      The Constitution provides safeguards to religious and linguistic
      minorities as part of our Fundamental Rights. Why have these minority
      groups been provided with these safeguards? The minority refers to
      communities that are numerically small in relation to the rest of the
      population. This concept goes well beyond numbers encompassing issues of
      power, access to resources with social and cultural dimensions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The culture of the majority influences the way in which society and
        government express themselves- size is a disadvantage and results in the
        marginalisation of the relatively smaller communities- hence, safeguards
        protect minority communities against being culturally dominated by the
        majority also protect them against any discrimination and
        disadvantage-Communities that are small in number relative to the rest
        of society may feel insecure about their lives, assets and well-being,
        which may get accentuated if the relations between the minority and
        majority communities are fraught-The Constitution provides these
        safeguards because it is committed to protecting India’s cultural
        diversity and promoting equality as well as justice-the judiciary plays
        a crucial role in upholding the law and enforcing Fundamental
        Rights-every citizen of India can approach the courts if they believe
        that their Fundamental Rights have been violated.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Muslims and Marginalisation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        14.2% of Indian Population (2011 Census)-Muslims are considered as a
        marginalised community as they have been deprived of the benefits of
        socio-economic development over the years. Muslims were lagging behind
        in terms of various development indicators- so the government set up a
        high-level committee in 2005- chaired by Justice Rajindar Sachar-The
        committee examined the social, economic and educational status of the
        Muslim community in India- The report discusses in detail the
        marginalisation of this community-suggests that on a range of social,
        economic and educational indicators the situation of the Muslim
        community is comparable to that of other marginalised communities like
        Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Economic and social marginalisation experienced by Muslims has other
        dimensions-Like other minorities, distinct Muslim customs and practices
        are apart from what is seen as the mainstream. Some may wear a burqa,
        sport a long beard, or wear a fez, leading to ways to identify all
        Muslims- they tend to be identified differently, and some people think
        they are not like the ‘rest of us’-thus causing them to be treated
        unfairly and discriminated against -This social marginalisation of
        Muslims has led to them migrating from places where they have lived,
        often leading to the ghettoisation of the community-Sometimes, this
        prejudice leads to hatred and violence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marginalisation, a complex phenomenon, requires a variety of strategies,
        measures and safeguards to redress this situation. All of us have a
        stake in protecting the rights defined in the Constitution and the Laws
        and Policies framed to realise these rights. Without these, we will
        never be able to protect the diversity that makes our country unique nor
        realise the State’s commitment to promoting equality for all.
      </li>
    </ul>
