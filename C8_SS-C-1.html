    <h2>Why Does a Country Need a Constitution?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A
        <span>Constitution</span>
        helps serve as a
        <span>set of rules and principles</span>
        that all persons in a country can agree upon as the basis of the way in
        which they want the country to be governed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The constitution also defines the
        <span>nature of a country’s political system.</span>
      </li>
      <p>
        <span>For example</span>
        , Nepal’s earlier Constitution stated that the country was to be ruled
        by the King and his council of ministers.
      </p>
      <li>
        The Constitution often lays down rules that guard against this misuse of
        power by our political leaders.
      </li>
      <p>
        <span>For example</span>
        : In the Indian Constitution, many laws contained in the section on
        Fundamental Rights.
      </p>
      <li>
        In a democracy, the Constitution also ensures that a
        <span>dominant group</span>
        does not use its power against other, less powerful people or groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Constitution helps to protect us against certain decisions that we
        might take that could have an adverse effect on the larger principles
        that the country believes in.
      </li>
      <p>
        <span>For Example</span>
        , it is possible that many people who live in a democracy might come to
        strongly feel that party politics has become so harsh that we need a
        strong dictator to set this right however, in the long run, dictatorial
        rule will be not fit.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Key Features of Indian Constitution</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The
        <span>long experience of oppressive rule</span>
        under the colonial state convinced Indians that free India should be a
        democracy in which everyone should be treated equally and be allowed to
        participate in government.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Constituent Assembly was formed in
        <span>1946</span>
        which comprised of
        <span>300</span>
        members who met periodically for the next three years to write India’s
        Constitution.
      </li>
      <p>
        → Various things are kept in mind while drawing up Constitution as the
        country was made up of several different communities who spoke different
        languages, belonged to different religions, and had distinct cultures.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Various Key features of India Constitution</h2>
    <h3>1. Federalism</h3>
    <p>
      It means existence of more than one level of government in the country. In
      India, there are three level of government - centre, state and Panchayati
      Raj. The Constitution defines the power of each government.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Parliamentary Form of Government</h3>
    <p>
      Constitution of India guarantees
      <span>universal adult suffrage</span>
      for all citizens means that the people of India have a direct role in
      electing their representatives. Also, every citizen of the country,
      irrespective of his/her social background, can also contest in elections.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Separation of Powers</h3>
    <p>
      According to the Constitution, there are three organs of the State - the
      legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The
        <span>legislature</span>
        refers to our elected representatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span>executive</span>
        are group of people who are responsible for implementing laws and
        running the government.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <span>judiciary</span>
        refers to the system of courts in this country.
      </li>

      rights are given to individuals against the State as well as against other
      individuals.
    </p>
